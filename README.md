<h1>Hi, I'm Indu! <br/><a href="https://github.com/indu-sen/indu-sen">Data/Business Analyst </a></h1> 

<p>I am a Data/Business Analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. 

I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, Google Cloud Platform (Google BigQuery), PowerBI, Tableau, and Looker. I have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging, and statistics. 

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Tableau and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

I have also included my work in programming languages such as Python, SQL and R. These projects showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.
