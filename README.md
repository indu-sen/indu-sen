<h1>Hi, I'm Indu! <br/><a href="https://github.com/indu-sen/indu-sen">Data/Business Analyst </a></h1>

<p>I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. 
  
  I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, PowerBI, and Tableau, and have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging, statistics, and critical thinking.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Power BI and Tableau. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

I have also included my work in programming languages such as Python, SQL and R. These projects showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.

In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.

I am confident that my data analytics skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon.
